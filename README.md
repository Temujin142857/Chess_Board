# Chess_Board

##Special thanks to mostefaiii for design support during the construction fo the GUI. 

A working chess board built using the Java Swing library. It allows en passant, promotion, check and checkmate detection, everything a chessboard needs.
It will eventually be expanded upon to have an A.I. opponent. 
There is currently no timer, might add one later.

Existing bugs:
There is an occasional bug where the grahics break upon launch, this bug occurs less than 1% of the time, and I'm not sure what causes it, as there's no randomness coded into the program at all. Possibly an interaction between JPanels I'm unaware of?

There is an occasional delay in clicking squares, I've confirmed that my code finishes executing faster than a human could reasonably make a move, so it likely has somehting to do with how I've set up the mouse listener. Similarly to the launch bug, for the scope of this project it's not worth fixing.
